# BinPacker

## About
Periodically I need to back up the files on my drive to DVD. This is just a simple Bin Packing algorithm implementation to help me figure out which files to assign to each disc and minimize the number of wasted space on each disk.

## Usage
`BinPacker.exe "path\to\file\" #ofBins #ofBytesPerBin `  

 Example for dual-layer DVD:
 
`BinPacker.exe "c:\listing.txt" 5 8547991552 ` 
 
 The output will be either a listing of Bins (representing disks) and which file goes into each, or error informing you that your files can't be packed into the number of bins provided

## Input format
The CSV file contains a list of item size and name, e.g.:

    897345, Item Name #1  
    985670, Item Name #2
